Greetings!

I've made a Light Weight Java Downloading Utility, that can download Audio, and Video from YouTube, by using a yt-dlp thingy.

I've used a design pattern, called process builer in this project, you can look through it and find it, made a small GUI with some dropboxes to choose between Audio/Video, and couple of buttons.

Mostly was for the practice, I would love if you will use it.

And stay blessed, TheAl1sha
